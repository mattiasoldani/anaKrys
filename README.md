This is **anaKrys**, a Python- and Jupyter-based data analysis software for the AXIAL/ELIOT team experimental studies on the electromagnetic interactions between high-energy particles and oriented crystalline lattices. In particular, it has been developed with a focus on the event-by-event analysis of the data collected during the fixed-target experiments performed at several high-energy particle beam facilities with the INSULAb detectors &mdash; further information on both the particle-crystal interaction physics and on the experimental setup features can be found, for example, [here](http://cds.cern.ch/record/1353904) and [here](http://annali.unife.it/iuss/article/view/1630).
